# Cost Splitter
Program for tracking expenses in groups, targetted towards roommates or sport groups.

## Log Expenses
When a large purchase is made by a single person to be split among a group, enter the amount and select the person that paid. The debt will
be automatically split between the other members assuming an equal share.

## Anyone can add Expenses
Expenses can be made by any group member at anytime, the debt is tracked from person to group rather than many person to person expenses.

## Reduce Complexity and Money Transfers
The aim of the program is to reduce the number of E-Transfers made between people. This is done by tracking how much a person is owed or owes
to the group rather than to individual people.
